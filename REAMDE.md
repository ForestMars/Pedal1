## Overview

Pedal 1 is a high-performance Python backend framework emphasizing
asynchronous execution, modular design, and clean separation of
concerns. It’s built for developers who demand scalable architectures
without unnecessary overhead. Whether you're prototyping fast or
building for production, Pedal 1 provides a battle-tested foundation.

## Features

- Async-first core with strategic use of `async/await`.
- Modular monolith architecture (easy to split into microservices
  later).
- Centralized config management with .env support.
- Clean repository pattern for persistence abstraction.
- Thin routers, fat services: maintainable and testable design.
- Standardized custom exception handling and error middleware.
- Lightweight, minimal dependencies — fast startup and low resource use.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Poetry (for dependency management) OR pip if preferred
- Git

### Quick Start

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/yourorg/pedal1.git
cd pedal1
poetry install
cp .env.example .env
poetry run python main.py
```

### Manual Pip Setup

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/yourorg/pedal1.git
cd pedal1
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
python main.py
```

## Usage

Once running, Pedal 1 serves its API endpoints via the server started in
`main.py`. You can extend functionality by adding routes under `routes/`
and binding services from `services/`.

Example API Call:

``` bash
curl http://localhost:8000/healthcheck
```

Response:

``` json
{"status": "ok"}
```

## Configuration

Settings are loaded from environment variables, with defaults handled
gracefully in `config/settings.py`. Customize your environment via the
`.env` file.

Essential Variables:

- `APP_ENV` - Set to "development", "production", etc.
- `DATABASE_URL` - Connection string for your database.

## Architecture

Pedal 1 uses a layered, modular architecture focused on clean separation
of concerns and future scalability. The app initializes via `main.py`,
setting up environment configs, dependencies, and launching the primary
server. Business logic lives in `services/` and `core/`, designed to
stay independent of infrastructure details. Persistence is handled by
repositories under `repositories/`, abstracting data access cleanly.

Routing and API endpoints are managed in `routes/`, following a
thin-controller, fat-service model. Config management is centralized in
`config/` with environment variable loading and fallback handling at
boot time. Asynchronous patterns (`async/await`) are used strategically
for IO-bound operations, ensuring non-blocking behavior.

The app favors an internal service-oriented modular monolith structure,
setting the stage for easy future decomposition into microservices if
needed. Error handling is standardized with custom exceptions and
centralized error middleware. Overall, Pedal 1 emphasizes clarity,
modularity, and operational readiness without overengineering.

## Tech Stack
